<h1>Audi RS 6</h1>
<hr>
<small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>
<p> The <strong> Audi RS 6 </strong> is a high-performance variant of the <a href alt> Audi A6 </a> range, produced by the high-performance subsidiary company <a href alt> Audi Sport GmbH</a>, for Audi AG, a division of the <a href alt>Volkswagen Group</a>.

<p><img src="https://wroom.ru/i2/carpic/66547.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></p>

<p>The first and second versions of the RS 6 were offered in both Avant and saloon forms. The third and fourth generations are only offered as an Avant.</p>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>"RS"</strong> initials are taken from the German: <i>RennSport</i> – literally translated as "racing sport", and is Audi's ultimate 'top-tier' high-performance trim level, positioned a noticeable step above the "S" model specification level of Audi's regular model range line-up. Like all <em>Audi "RS" models</em>, the RS 6 pioneers some of Audi's newest and most advanced engineering and technology, and so could be described as a halo vehicle, with the latest RS 6 Performance having the equal most powerful internal combustion engine out of all Audi models, with the same horsepower and torque as the physically larger Audi S8 Plus. Unlike the A6 and S6, however, the RS 6's engines in the C5 and C6 iterations have not been shared with any other vehicle in Audi's lineup. However, for the C7 generation, the Audi RS 6 has the same 4.0L bi-turbo V8 engine as the Audi RS 7, with both being positioned at the top of the Audi S and RS range, and detuned variants of the same engines are found in the Audi S8, Audi A8, and Audi S6.

<p>Based on the A6 platform, the RS 6's engines are front-mounted and longitudinally oriented, while the <mark>transmission</mark> is mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle. Like all S and RS models, the RS 6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.</p>

The <a href alt>C5 RS 6</a>was the fourth model to come out of Audi's private subsidiary company, "quattro GmbH". The first was the Audi RS 2 Avant, from a joint venture between Porsche and Quattro GmbH for the Audi marque. The second was the Audi C4 S6 Plus, produced from <strong>April 1996 to July 1997</strong>. The third was <strong>the 2000 Audi B5 RS 4</strong>; the fifth was the <strong>2005 Audi B7 A4 DTM Edition saloon</strong>, and the sixth was the <strong>2006 Audi B7 RS 4</strong>. The seventh and current (as of January 2010) Quattro GmbH model is the latest Audi C6 RS 6.

<p>Production of the <i>original Audi C5 RS 6</i> began in June 2002 and ended in September 2004. The second Audi C6 RS 6 was introduced at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The original RS 6 (C5) was the first Audi RS variant exported to North America, while the C6 and C7 RS 6 were only sold in Europe, with the C8 RS 6 again being offering in North America.</p>

Main rivals for the Audi RS 6 are the <em>BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E 55/E 63 AMG</em>.</p>

<h2>C5 (Typ 4B, 2002–2004)</h2>
<hr>
<p>The original <b>Audi C5 RS 6 Quattro (Typ 4B)</b> was the top-of-the-line user of the Volkswagen Group C5 platform (1997–2004), and was initially available as a five-door five-seat Avant - Audis name for an estate or station wagon. A four-door five-seat saloon/sedan followed shortly after the launch of the Avant. Derived from the <a href alt>Audi C5 S6</a>(itself derived from the Audi C5 A6), the RS 6 also shares the aluminium structure from the firewall and forward with the C5 A6s with V8 engines (A6 4.2 V8 Quattro, S6 saloon/Avant). It was manufactured from July 2002 through to September 2004.</p>

<dt> <b> C5 powertrain </b> <dt>
<dd>For the <i>C5 RS 6</i> powertrain detail, the engine is an all-aluminium alloy 4,172 cubic centimetres (254.6 cu in) twin-turbocharged ('biturbo'), double overhead camshaft, 5 valve per cylinder version of Audi's 4.2-litre 90° V8 petrol engine (parts code prefix: 077, <strong> identification </strong> code: BCY), developed and manufactured in Germany and the UK by quattro GmbH and Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). With the addition of the two turbochargers (one per cylinder bank), the power output of the V8 engine was increased to 331 kW (450 PS; 444 bhp) at 5,700 to 6,400 rpm, and generated 580 N⋅m (428 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The combination of the 4.2-litre V8, variable inlet valve timing, and twin turbochargers gave the RS 6 an exceptionally wide power band, with peak torque available from 1,950 to 5,600 rpm.</dd>
<dt> <b> C5 suspension and steering </b> </dt>
<dd> Utilising the same fully independent four-link front suspension, and double wishbone rear, as its related <mark>A6 and S6</mark>, the RS 6 was lowered by 20 millimetres (0.79 in), with a 30% stiffer spring rate, and 40% increased compression damping. <a href alt>The RS6</a> also served as the debut model for Audi's "Dynamic Ride Control" (DRC) system. The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual dampers (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching. The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and a high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking. The DRC's main advantage is that it operates without the need for complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from Mercedes-Benz and other competitors. Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing multiple replacements of faulty <i>DRC</i> units and many drivers have opted to replace the system with simpler and more reliable aftermarket coil-over suspension.</dd>
<dt><b>C5 RS 6 in auto racing</b></dt>
<dd>The RS 6 was used in the North American <strong>SPEED World Challenge GT Series</strong> of auto racing for three years - 2002 to 2004, claiming the manufacturers' championship victory successively in all three years. Once again, the special race derivative of the twin-turbo V8 engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by <i>Cosworth Technology </i>(now known as MAHLE Powertrain). However, the 2005 season proved difficult due to performance restrictions imposed on Champion Audi Racing by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), with Champion deciding to run a different wheel diameter, and the trade-off was reducing boost pressure.</dd>
